# daq.io LabVIEW API 2.0
How to get started with the daq.io LabVIEW API 2.0

# Important:
The version 2.0 of the LabVIEW API breaks the old version!
- all OOP code was removed to make adaptations to the code easier
- "assets" were added as new functional routes

# Improvements:
- The examples can now be executed on any RIO target
- All routes have been fixed and tested
